#Viral Topic Spread
Overview
The Viral Topic Spread project is a simulation and analysis tool designed to model the spread of viral topics across social networks, inspired by epidemiological models like SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered). This project aims to help researchers, data scientists, and social media analysts understand how information, trends, or memes propagate through platforms like X, Reddit, or other networks. It provides a flexible framework to simulate topic virality, analyze network dynamics, and visualize the spread of information over time.
The project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as NetworkX for graph-based modeling, Matplotlib for visualization, and NumPy for numerical computations. It is designed to be modular, allowing users to customize parameters like transmission rates, network structures, and recovery rates to simulate various scenarios.
Features

Network Modeling: Simulate topic spread over different network topologies (e.g., random, scale-free, or small-world networks).
Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters such as virality rate, recovery rate, and network size to study different scenarios.
Visualization: Generate interactive visualizations of topic spread dynamics using Matplotlib or Plotly.
Data Analysis: Analyze the spread patterns and identify key influencers or super-spreaders in the network.
Extensibility: Easily integrate with real-world datasets from social media platforms (e.g., X API) for empirical analysis.

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Git (for cloning the repository)

Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:

networkx for network modeling
matplotlib for visualization
numpy for numerical computations
plotly (optional) for interactive visualizations
pandas (optional) for data handling

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/YeaomunTousif/viral-topic-spread.git
cd viral-topic-spread


Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Verify Installation:Run the example script to ensure everything is set up correctly:
python examples/run_simulation.py



Usage
Basic Simulation
To run a basic simulation of viral topic spread:

Navigate to the project directory.
Run the main simulation script:python src/main.py --network_type scale-free --nodes 1000 --virality_rate 0.1 --recovery_rate 0.05

This command simulates topic spread on a scale-free network with 1000 nodes, a virality rate of 0.1, and a recovery rate of 0.05.

Command-Line Arguments
The main script accepts the following arguments:

--network_type: Type of network (random, scale-free, small-world). Default: scale-free.
--nodes: Number of nodes in the network. Default: 1000.
--virality_rate: Probability of a node adopting the topic from an infected neighbor. Default: 0.1.
--recovery_rate: Probability of a node losing interest in the topic. Default: 0.05.
--output_dir: Directory to save simulation results and visualizations. Default: output/.

Example Output
Running the simulation will generate:

A plot showing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered nodes over time.
A CSV file (output/spread_data.csv) containing the simulation data.
(Optional) An interactive HTML visualization if Plotly is used.

Analyzing Real-World Data
To analyze real-world social media data:

Obtain data from a platform (e.g., using the X API).
Preprocess the data using the provided script:python src/preprocess_data.py --input_file data/tweets.csv --output_file data/processed_network.csv


Run the simulation with the processed data:python src/main.py --input_file data/processed_network.csv
